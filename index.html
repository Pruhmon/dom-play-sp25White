            <p><strong>Assignment Overview:</strong></p>
            <p>
                This page is part of an interactive project where we explore DOM manipulation in HTML and CSS. The main goal is to dynamically display a dialogue from a scene, with each character's lines tagged with a <code>data-actor</code> attribute. This allows us to easily apply styles or interact with the page based on the characters or actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project involves understanding how to structure and manipulate content, as well as how to leverage custom attributes to represent metadata for each element. In this case, the page displays lines from a script with characters speaking in a play or performance, making it a useful tool for simulating a script reader or an interactive story.

            <p><span data-actor="lord-kfc">LORD KFC: So, Xenu, we’ve gone from interstellar prisons to soul-scanning gadgets. Still trying to sell people salvation through sci-fi?</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="xenu">XENU: And you're still pushing ancient rituals and bearded obedience? At least I let people level up.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="action">A glowing portal suddenly opens mid-air, slurping with garlic-scented steam. PRAMAN THE SCHOLAR steps out, robes flowing like boiling pasta water.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="praman">PRAMAN: Gentlemen, please. You squabble over outdated doctrines and space-drama. Have you considered... the Flying Spaghetti Monster?</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="xenu">XENU (raising an eyebrow): The what?</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="lord-kfc">LORD KFC: Is this a cooking class or a prophecy?</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="praman">PRAMAN: Neither. It’s enlightenment through carbs. Love, randomness, and meatball-based metaphysics. We call it “Pastafarianism.”</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="xenu">XENU: This is absurd.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="praman">PRAMAN: And yet... no wars were ever started over penne.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="lord-kfc">LORD KFC (chuckling): He’s got a point.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="xenu">XENU: No, what he has is a food blog disguised as a belief system.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="praman">PRAMAN: Wrong. We believe in logic *and* laughter. In questioning everything. Even marinara.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="action">Lightning cracks in the background. A meatball rolls slowly across the stage. Silence follows.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="lord-kfc">LORD KFC: You know what? Between laser volcanoes and spaghetti, I’ll take the sauce.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="praman">PRAMAN: R’amen, brother.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="xenu">XENU (sighs): I traveled galaxies for this?</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="action">They all stare at each other. Somewhere in the distance, a colander glows on a mountaintop.</span></p>
